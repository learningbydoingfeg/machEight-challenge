for testing this piece of code, you should add the list of numbers that you want to obtain pairs which summed is equal to the desired value as an array.

ex: 

const list = [1, 9, 5, 0, 20, -4, 12, 16, 7];
const desiredValue = 12;

this runs on node v16.15.1 just modify the index.js file with the the list and desired values and run

node index.js on your terminal.
